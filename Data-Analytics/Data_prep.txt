-taxi busyness data
-rental prices info 
-legally operating business
-metro data
-census
-abandonned

to do-data:

to do-Analytics:
-remove extreme outliers 
-check logical integrity

model:
-figure out which data would be useful inputs
-target feature if any.
-supervised vs unsupervised, likely unsupervised due to amalgamation of dataset
